# vsqx2mba
python-based vsqx to moonbase alpha tts (DecTalk) converter

Is it poorly written? yeah

Will I have to modify the code to get it to sound right? Almost certainly

Will you be there to fix it or help me if something goes wrong? Maybe or maybe not. find my contact info on my page and see how it goes.

Do effects work? no. please remove all fancy stuff if you even want to hear it.


Usage: 

make sure there is only one singer and track in the vsqx. 

edit mba.py to change the line with the obj = open(... and change the string there from 'ready steady.vsqx' to whatever the filename of your vsqx is. 

copy and paste printout (without the number at the beginning) into mba chat.
